# Image Processing Project 1

This repository contains code for an image processing project that includes various functionalities such as histogram equalization, image quantization, color space transformations, and gamma correction. The project aims to provide tools for manipulating and enhancing images using different techniques.

## Features
* Histogram Equalization: Enhance the contrast of an image by equalizing its histogram.
* Image Quantization: Reduce the number of colors in an image to a specified quantization level.
* Color Space Transformations: Convert images between different color spaces, such as RGB and YIQ.
* Gamma Correction: Adjust the gamma value of an image to control its brightness and contrast.
